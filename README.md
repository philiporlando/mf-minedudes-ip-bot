A small R utility that notifies a discord channel when the public IP address of a minecraft server has changed. 

Not everyone can afford business-tier internet and static IP addresses, but we all deserve to play Minecraft with our homies. This R utility can be scheduled as a cron job on a Minecraft server. If any changes to the public IP address are detected on this server, other players are notified via a dedicated Discord channel.
